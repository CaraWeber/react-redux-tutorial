## My Plate (A React, React-Redux, and React-Router tutorial)

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm start (you should be getting a reducer error and several warnings - complete the todos to fix this)
4. See index.js and the components, containers, and reducers folders for todos
5. Goal: to build an app with two views, a menu (at '/menu') and a plate (at '/plate')
6. The menu view should have a list of all menu items (see items.js)
7. You should be able to click on menu items to add them to your plate
8. The plate view should have a list of all items you have added to your plate
9. State will consist of the menu (an array of objects), and the plate (an array of objects)
